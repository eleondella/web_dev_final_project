Historically, diverse forms, practices and understanding of life have been translated into universalist political-theoritical categories of deeply European origin. This course will help students enhance their understanding of translation by connecting these two trends. The course will start from the \"cultural turn\" of translation studies. It will take a critical look at the notion of translation and explore the agent of power and ideology in translation.

In particular, it aims to give you an overview of the state of the 'sociology of class' today.

Cosmology refers to understandings of the universe as an ordered whole. In many cultures, this understanding is primarily a religious world view. Cosmologies not only provide an explanation of why the natural environment is the way it is, they also explain the nature of human existence and how people should relate to each other and to the world around them. We will begin this course by looking at a cross-cultural range of cosmologies from both small scale societies, such as Australian Aborigines or Amazonian Indians, and\u00a0world religions, such as Islam. We will then look at various theories that anthropologists have offered to help us understand how humans order and relate to the world around them. This will include considering some classic works (Tylor on animism; Douglas on classification, purity and danger; Geertz on religion as a cultural system; and Levi-Strauss on myth analysis) and critiques of these studies. The final part of the course\u00a0will look critically at what constitutes knowledge and how we are to deal with people whose understanding of how the world works is very different from our own. Anthropologists attempt to understand cultural phenomenon from 'the native's point of view'. However, it is difficult to avoid being influenced by the views of our own culture (including the views of the academic disciplines we have been trained in). We will explore issues of knowledge, rationality and 'science' by focusing on how anthropologists,\u00a0and other social scientists,\u00a0have studied fundamentalism, shamanism, witchcraft, and 'native' notions of human conception.

The course combines an exploration of key theoretical and conceptual frameworks from sociology and related disciplines with the analysis of empirical material foregrounding the perspectives of migrants themselves as well as political and policy perspectives. Central to the course is the exploration of key debates around citizenships, diversity, multiculturalism, belonging and social cohesion. We will explore the role these debates play in migrants' sense of home and belonging, as well as look at how difference is experienced and negotiated on an everyday basis in UK cities and neighbourhoods. Drawing from sociological, social-anthropological and policy debates, we will address questions such as: what different forms of citizenship exist and how might these be practiced in society? How do migrants forge a sense of identity and belonging across geopolitical and cultural borders? What is the relationship between racial and ethno-cultural diversity and citizenship? What facilitates or hinders the integration of settled migrant groups and individuals?

The course then compares national consciousness with other forms of consciousness, particularly class consciousness, and nationalism with other forms of identity-based politics, particularly those based on ethnicity and 'race'.

However, it was a Russia\u00a0that was situated within a wider context of growing global inter-dependency and exchange, regional de-colonisation and nation building, and internal economic, social, political and cultural upheaval and crisis. The aim of this module is to explore the idea of Russia almost two decades on from 1991: as a 'state' and 'nation' which has gone through, and is still engaged in, the process of re-negotiating its identity at the global, national, regional, and local levels. The course examines internal and external issues of relevance in the contemporary period (including Russia's relations with the West and the countries of the former Soviet Union, particularly Central Asia; internal and external migration; the role and identity of Russian Diaspora communities, the role of religion and Islam; the existence and nature of ethnic conflict), and explores how in these different spheres identities are being re-shaped both at the level of the Russian state and the level of the Russian people. The module adopts an approach that combines utilisation of key theoretical and conceptual frameworks (nationalism, ethnicity, globalisation, post-colonialism) with analysis of more grounded empirical perspectives. The module makes reference to Russia's historical (imperial) past (which is covered during a first semester module: Constructing Identities in Soviet Russia: Local, National and Global Perspectives)."}, {"url": "/coursecatalogue/course/?code=CEES4043", "title": "POST-COMMUNIST TRANSFORMATION AND EUROPEAN INTEGRATION IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE", "description": "This is an Honours course taught by Central and East European Studies.

Often this involves sociologists saying something is wrong or 'unfair' so, if we say something is wrong or unfair, what's the alternative? This is a question sociologists have been dealing with since the beginning of the discipline: should sociologists offer alternatives and, if they should, how should they go about it? These are the questions you will study on this course. We will consider whether sociology should be about saying what should happen, or whether it is a discipline concerned simply with explaining what is; to put it in the correct terminology, is sociology a value-free discipline? From here we will look at the alternatives some sociologists and social theorists, such as Durkheim, Du Bois, Mead, Dworkin, Mannheim, Marcuse, Giddens and Levitas have offered and consider the role sociologists should play.  Among these alternatives are questions such as: should inheritance be banned? Would a distinct co-operative economic structure help lessen racial inequality? Should sociologists teach us what we norms we should follow? Should we ban pornography? Would a basic income lessen economic inequality? And what does it mean to say we should be led by a concern not for profit but for beauty? From there we will discuss whether, in furthering such ideas, sociologists should be taking to the streets with social movements, organising in the local community, working for the government to create policy or writing newspaper articles/appearing on TV to contribute to public debate?

SPS consciously integrates critical elements of planning theory and essential skills in spatial planning. This link between skills, critical thinking and planning theory runs throughout the course and is emphasised through lectures, workshops, group work and seminars. To give it a real-life feel, SPS is assessed through a group project comprising a challenging integrated spatial planning framework (75%) and a presentation (25%). The course is taught by a large number of experts from academia and practice, in the private and public sector, who work at a national, regional and local level. In this course, you get their hands dirty and take charge of the learning process through independently organised meetings to prepare for workshops and the group project.
