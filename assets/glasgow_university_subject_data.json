Broadly the methods may be categorized into time-domain and frequency-domain methods. Time-domain methods develop explicit models for the evolution of a process over time. Frequency-domain methods equivalently model the correlation structure of the time series. Other topics include methods for model-based estimation, model selection, diagnostics, forecasting, and computing as they relate to time series analysis."

The course has two main aims. One is to promote an understanding of how the economies of transition evolve from less developed to developed status. The other is to provide an analytical framework for evaluating strategies of growth and development, including an assessment of how finance may contribute to these. Course objectives are interdependent and a high premium is placed on a critical approach to the models considered and an understanding of their empirical basis."

It concentrates on setting out the essential building blocks of modern macroeconomic theory by covering: the theory of firms and long-run growth; the theory of households and asset pricing; economic inequality at the macro-economic level; and household heterogeneity and the link between aggregate outcomes and inequality. The unifying approach adopted throughout is based on the principles that households maximise utility subject to their budget constraints; firms maximise profits subject to the demand for their product and costs of production; and prices adjust such that an equilibrium exists and markets clear. Finally, macroeconomic economic data will be introduced and discussed to help students to understand and assess the predictions of the theory."

The course continues with the common modelling of multivariate time series (VAR, VECM), and forecasting.  Secondly, this course emphasises how students apply the time series models to financial applications such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates, dynamic hedge and risk management. Finally, this course introduces a modelling of financial panel data."

We then touch upon the issue of transmission mechanism of monetary policy. Banks are the subject of more detailed analysis, including bank runs and bank regulation. We finish by studying financial liberalisation and the factors that led to the financial crisis of 2008-2010."

In doing so, we also explore the use of unconventional monetary policies following the financial crisis. Next we examine the monetary transmission mechanism. The course concludes by looking at issues in the design of optimal monetary policy institutions, at the time-inconsistency problem and at the desirability of inflation targeting and/or an independent central bank."

In considering the day to day running of operational HRM the main functions of recruitment and selection, performance management and pay and reward are introduced and debated. In tandem the strategic elements of HRM in assuring that HR policies are working towards achieving organisational goals are critically addressed. Challenges for the delivery of strategic and operational HRM within specific international and sectorial contexts are discussed and debated."

In addition, it presents some of the formal economic analysis relating to the optimal use / depletion of natural resources and the basic economic theory relating to pollution externalities and the options for regulation. On successful completion of the course, students should be able to identify different categories of resources; appreciate and analyse the implications of a closed thermodynamic system for economic activity; explain the reasons for both historical and current concerns over resource limitations; discuss differing interpretations of the concept of sustainability and recognise the key implications for development; demonstrate an appreciation of the standard economic theory of natural resource economics and its limitations; and comment critically on the feasibility of 'Sustainable Development'."

Most private law subjects are taught in years 1 and 2 of the LLB degree and are compulsory professional subjects. The requirement to cover the Law Society's curriculum often leaves little room for broader discussion of theoretical and contextual issues.  The focus of this course will be on aspects of private law which impact on public policy, particularly those which are currently (or have recently been) on the reform agenda either for the Scottish Law Commission or more generally for the Scottish Parliament.  The course outline is formulated in a deliberately broad and topical way in order to be able to incorporate different aspects of private law as the policy agenda changes.  Seminars will concentrate on the way in which private law rules impact on the lives of citizens and the political choices which inform those rules."

Topics to be addressed will include arranged and forced marriages; polygamy; the treatment of forms of marriage and civil partnership, and forms of divorce/dissolution, which are unknown in Scots domestic law; the rules relation to recognition of foreign judicial and extra-judicial divorces/dissolutions, EU and non-EU; cross-border property matters and financial remedies affecting families; the cross-border treatment of parental rights and responsibilities; inter-country adoption; cross-border surrogacy; and international child abduction.

Key ideas developed by the Romans are part of our permanent inheritance: private and public law, ownership, personal rights, and most important, justice found in careful legal reasoning. In this course we discuss a selection of topics which show the Romans at their best: legal debates, legal process, and their highly developed law of sale. Wherever possible we study private documents, and discuss how those documents reveal the legal realities of Roman life."

The study of the above issues will be supported by investigations into current or past events such as the Kosovo case, the Gulf wars and so on.

In particular the fundamental group will be introduced: this is the first example of a standard type of construction in algebraic topology, namely a functorial assignment of an algebraic structure to spaces  (in this case groups). This will be used to classify surfaces up to homeomorphism and to study covering spaces and their relationships with the fundamental group, illustrating the close links between group theory and geometry and topology via the Galois correspondence between topological objects (covering spaces) and algebraic objects (subgroups of the fundamental group). The course will conclude with a look at the mathematics of knots and braids, seemingly simple objects which have extraordinary importance in mathematics and beyond."

In particular the fundamental group will be introduced: this is the first example of a standard type of construction in algebraic topology, namely a functorial assignment of an algebraic structure to spaces  (in this case groups). This will be used to classify surfaces up to homeomorphism and to study covering spaces and their relationships with the fundamental group, illustrating the close links between group theory and geometry and topology via the Galois correspondence between topological objects (covering spaces) and algebraic objects (subgroups of the fundamental group). The course will conclude with a look at the mathematics of knots and braids, seemingly simple objects which have extraordinary importance in mathematics and beyond."
