Cosmology refers to understandings of the universe as an ordered whole. In many cultures, this understanding is primarily a religious world view. Cosmologies not only provide an explanation of why the natural environment is the way it is, they also explain the nature of human existence and how people should relate to each other and to the world around them. We will begin this course by looking at a cross-cultural range of cosmologies from both small scale societies, such as Australian Aborigines or Amazonian Indians, and\u00a0world religions, such as Islam. We will then look at various theories that anthropologists have offered to help us understand how humans order and relate to the world around them. This will include considering some classic works (Tylor on animism; Douglas on classification, purity and danger; Geertz on religion as a cultural system; and Levi-Strauss on myth analysis) and critiques of these studies. The final part of the course\u00a0will look critically at what constitutes knowledge and how we are to deal with people whose understanding of how the world works is very different from our own. Anthropologists attempt to understand cultural phenomenon from 'the native's point of view'. However, it is difficult to avoid being influenced by the views of our own culture (including the views of the academic disciplines we have been trained in). We will explore issues of knowledge, rationality and 'science' by focusing on how anthropologists,\u00a0and other social scientists,\u00a0have studied fundamentalism, shamanism, witchcraft, and 'native' notions of human conception. Please note\u00a0that this course\u00a0was designed as a companion to Ritual, Society and Change.

The course will also draw students' attention to the ways in which 'knowledge' is created and the biases and silences which can arise as a result.

The course examines internal and external issues of relevance in the contemporary period (including Russia's relations with the West and the countries of the former Soviet Union, particularly Central Asia; internal and external migration; the role and identity of Russian Diaspora communities, the role of religion and Islam; the existence and nature of ethnic conflict), and explores how in these different spheres identities are being re-shaped both at the level of the Russian state and the level of the Russian people. The module adopts an approach that combines utilisation of key theoretical and conceptual frameworks (nationalism, ethnicity, globalisation, post-colonialism) with analysis of more grounded empirical perspectives.

From here we will look at the alternatives some sociologists and social theorists, such as Durkheim, Du Bois, Mead, Dworkin, Mannheim, Marcuse, Giddens and Levitas have offered and consider the role sociologists should play.  Among these alternatives are questions such as: should inheritance be banned? Would a distinct co-operative economic structure help lessen racial inequality? Should sociologists teach us what we norms we should follow? Should we ban pornography? Would a basic income lessen economic inequality? And what does it mean to say we should be led by a concern not for profit but for beauty?
